ONE QUESTION.
 The length of the Solution must be kept in mind while preparing different types of problems.
 While preparing question paper, avoid problems from the text book as it is, Can take those
problems by changing their nature of questioning.
 The entire question paper should be prepared in such a way that 50% questions easy, 30%
questions are average and the remaining 20% questions are of higher order thinking.Mathematics – X E/M

GUIDELINES FOR SETTING QUESTIONS
IN
ENGLISH
General Instructions:
1. It should be borne in mind that syllabus is the main guiding factor which should not only be read but strictly
adhered to before trying our hand at setting the questions.
2. If the question setter finds some variation between the syllabus and the sample paper, the syllabus is to be
religiously followed.
3. Directional language of the questions should be standardised so that different question setters do not use
different sets of language for the same purpose. For example “ Read the passage given below and answer the
questions that follow,” is not only preferable but far better than “Read the following passage and answer the
questions that follow,” and “Read the following passage and answer the questions given below. “Standard
language used in previous years’ Board question papers may be followed.
4. Word limit of answers to the questions wherever needed should be the same as given in the syllabus and it
should be a part of the question itself and not mentioned within the brackets at the end.
5. Before framing a question, the question setter should be clear in his mind as to what he expects as an answer.
The directions should therefore be clearly worded. The paper setter should also be very sure whether the
answer can be given within the specified word limit.
SECTION A (READING)
6. Students of several streams have to attempt language papers. Topics of general interest should be selected
instead of very specialised ones which cater to the needs of only specific groups requiring a techinical vocabu-
lary. However, the passages may be literary or biographical, a travelogue or a piece of fiction. There must not
be any religious, political, social and gender bias.
7. The questions, specifically on the passage for comprehension, whether they are direct, inferential or
extrapolative, should have answers within the text.
8. While choosing a passage or framing questions, interest of the average students [nearly 70%] should be kept
in mind. However 15% weightage has to be given to the questions for the bright and the remaining 15% for
below average students. Passages should not be copied from guide books.
2
SECTION B (WRITING)
9. The aim of this section is to test the writing skills of the candidates. Wherever required, according to the
syllabus, verbal input in the questions must be provided. But it should be neither too short nor too long.
10. Situations chosen for writing task should be within the experience of an average candidate. It should not be, for
example, on topics such as “Visit to France,” “Skiing in switzerland etc,” as it is beyond the experience of most
of the candidates.
11. Visuals given as input often do not throw much light on the questions asked and are often unclear. A visual
should be so clear that it can be easily printed.
SECTION C (GRAMMAR)
12. The exercise in jumbled words to be arranged in sentences should not consist of isolated sentences.
They should be asked in a context. Number of words in each sentence should not ordinarily exceed 15.
13. Maximum number of items of grammar as prescribed in the syllabus should be tested in context and not in
isolation. For example in the question on change of narration, there should be a running paragraph instead of
isolated sentences.
SECTION D (TEXT BOOK/LITERATURE)
14. Before framing a question, the question setter should be clear in his mind as to what he expects as an answer.
The directions should therefore be clearly worded. The paper setter should also be very sure whether the
answer can be given within the specified word limit.",CBSE

 MCQ
  1. Alternate answers should be as (A), (B), (C) and (D) and not as 1, 2, 3, 4 or a, b, c, d.
  2. The alternatives should not be written at random. They must be the probable answers For Example:- The surface area of a solid hemisphere of diameter 14cm is (A) 147元 (B) 98元 (C) 392元 (D) 588π The correct answer is 3(7)² = 147π ί.ε. (Α) But taking corved surface area = 2π(7) = 98 i.e. (B) taking r= 14 instead of 7 and surface area = 2(14)² = 392 i.e. (C) and r=14 and surface area 2tr588 ie. (D)
 3. The stem of the question should not be interogative type. e.g. ""What does the Congruence rule SAS mean?"" instead of should be witten as, ""The Congruence rule SAS means"" (A) (B) (C) (D)
  4. The questions should be such that the answer may be in one word or one sentence. Questions of the type, ""show that"", ""verify that"" etc. should be avoided
   5. The questions should not have multiple answers. e.g. Ifx=36, the value of x is (A) 6 (B) -6 (C) +6 (D) 36 Options A, B and C can be said as correct. 
   6. Syllabus, Design and blue print must be striclty followed. 
   7. The questions should not involve long calculations.
   8. Proper units should be mentioned in the questions, wherever required. 1 FOR QUESTIONS OTHER THAN MCQ 
   9. The questions of different weightages should be so framed that an average student can solve the question in less than 2 minutes for every one mark. i.e a 3 marks question should not take more than 6 minutes.
    10. Questions should be framed to test different skills like computation, drawing, reasoning etc. 
   11. The questions framed should have value points as per the weightage of the question ie. a 2 marks questions must not have more than 2 important value points. 
   12. The language of the question should be such that it conveys specific meaning. e.g. The surface area of a cylinder is - here, the language can mean curved surface area or total surface area, if cylinder is solid.
    13. The figures given must be properly labelled and according to dimensions. 
   14. Sub-parts in a questions should be avoided.

NOTE: Teachers are advised to:
i. encourage classroom interaction among peers, students and teachers through activities
such as role play, group work etc,
ii. reduce teacher-talking time and keep it to the minimum,
iii. take up questions for discussion to encourage pupils to participate and to marshal their
ideas and express and defend their views, and
iv. use the scale of assessment for conversation skills to test the students for continuous as-
sessment.
Besides measuring attainment, texts serve the dual purpose of diagnosing mistakes and areas of
non-learning. To make evaluation a true index of learners' attainment, each language skill is to be31
assessed through a judicious mixture of different types of questions. In addition to the summative
tests, formative assessment is essential to measure the level of attainment in the four language skills
and the learners' communicative competence. Formative assessment should be done through 'in
class' activities throughout the year.",CBSE
